### I also enjoy painting! Oils and acrylics are my preferred media. 
#### Here are some of the highlights:

![floating-city](/images/floating_city.jpg)
*Iquitos, Peru (2015). One of my favourite memories, from years ago, on a trip to Iquitos for my Peruvian roommate's (at the time) wedding.*

![solo1](/images/solo1.jpg)
*Way 1 (2013). Is there a good story behind this triptych?*

![solo2](/images/solo2.jpg)
*Way 2 (2013). Perhaps.*

![solo3](/images/solo3.jpg)
*Way 3 (2013). But, I will resist divulging it for fear of tarnishing the viewer's imagination.*

![university](/images/UofT.jpg)
*University of Toronto (2016). This is Victoria College, one of those Hogwarts-esque buildings at the University of Toronto, where I did my undergrad.*

![brother](/images/rainni.jpg)
*Rainni (2012). Yes -- it is my brother, Rainni, who was roped into this modelling gig for my art project.*

![shiny-objects](/images/shinyobj.jpg)
*Reflections (2015). A study of reflective surfaces.*

![hands](/images/hands.jpg)
*Hands (2016). Hands are one of the most delightful things to sketch imo, probably because they are as varied as the people who possess them.*
