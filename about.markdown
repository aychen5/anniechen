## Welcome!

:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
Hello! I am a graduate student at McGill University in the Department of Political Science, and a member of the [Centre for the Study of Democratic Citizenship](https://csdc-cecd.ca/). I am broadly interested in deploying experimental design and statistical techniques to make causal inferences in service of social science questions. I study comparative voting behaviour and electoral institutions. Before coming to McGill, I received a BA at the University of Toronto, where I double majored in Political Science and Criminology. | ![profile-picture](/images/PF.jpg){:height="400px" width="200px"}
