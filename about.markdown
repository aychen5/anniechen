Hello! I am a graduate student at McGill University in the Department of Political Science, and a member of the [Centre for the Study of Democratic Citizenship](https://csdc-cecd.ca/). I am broadly interested in deploying experimental design and statistical techniques to make causal inferences in service of social science questions. I study comparative voting behaviour and electoral institutions.

Before coming to McGill, I received a BA at the University of Toronto, where I double majored in Political Science and Criminology.
